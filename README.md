## 🗺️ The Production Pathway
Since junior year I knew I wanted to create a portfolio that not only reflectecd my coding skills but also reflected my personality. Embarking on this journey was no small feet as I had no coding experience regarding webdevelopment and didn't even really know how I wanted it to look. It took many youtube videos, Stackoverflow florums, and plenty of Chatgpt prompts but after many different drafts and revisions I was able to make something that I can call mine. Looking back on it I already want to do something different but that just cause I want it to reflect my personality a bit more. Thats for another time and project, but for now I'm glad I have to something to present as my own.
